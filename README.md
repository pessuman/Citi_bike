The New York Citi Bike Program is the largest bike sharing program in the United States.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. 

The purpose of this project was to build a set of data reports to provide answers based on the data collected from the bike sharing program, and also to improve the city program.


The data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs were aggregated to build a data dashboard, story, and report.
Multiple datasets from different periods were chosen and the data was merged for the analysis.

## The following are some questions that were tackled: 

- How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

- By what percentage has total ridership grown?

- How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
